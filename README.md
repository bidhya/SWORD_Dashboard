# SWORD Dashboard
Source code for developing and maintaining the online SWORD Dashboard.

The "assets" directory contains logos and scripts to produce the SWORD maps, basin maps, and node files contained in a "data" directory. 

The "data" directory contains the SWORD maps, basin maps, and node files used to display SWORD information in the main app. This directory will be created when running the scripts for the first time.
